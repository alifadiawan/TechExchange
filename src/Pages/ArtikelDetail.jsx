Thanks for reading! These are some of the tips I‚Äôve personally bookmarked for myself‚Äîthings I‚Äôve learned the hard way while coding, talking to dev friends, and working on real projects.

When I first started, I used to guess why my code was slow instead of measuring. I‚Äôd optimize random parts of my code and still wonder why things weren‚Äôt getting faster. Over time, I realized that pro developers don‚Äôt just ‚Äúwrite fast code‚Äù by instinct‚Äîthey use tools, measure, and optimize what actually matters.

I wrote this to save you from making the same mistakes I did. Hopefully, now you have a clearer roadmap to writing faster, more efficient code‚Äîwithout the frustration I went through! üöÄ

If you found this helpful, bookmark it for later, and feel free to share it with a fellow dev who might be struggling with slow code too.

                                    Here's the truth: slow code doesn't have to be the end of the world. And it's a rite of passage if you're a developer.

                                    When you're learning to code, you're focused on making things work‚Äînot making them fast. But eventually, you'll hit a wall: your app freezes, your data script takes hours, or your game lags like a PowerPoint slideshow.
                                </p>

                                    The difference between working code and blazing-fast code often comes down to avoiding a few common mistakes. Mistakes that are easy to make when you're starting out, like using the wrong tool for the job, writing unnecessary code, or accidentally torturing your computer with hidden inefficiencies.

                                        Logging is supposed to help you understand what's happening in your code‚Äîbut if you're logging everything, you're actually slowing it down. A common beginner mistake is leaving print() statements everywhere or enabling verbose logging even in production, where performance matters most.
